# Flask_RESTplus
Flask-Restplus + Docker exploration + CI pipelne
## Purposes
1. learn flask restplus
2. learn good practices of flask application development using factory pattern, migrations,environments...
3. learn to use both docker and docker-compose (on an old laptop running ubuntu server)
4. create a very simple CI pipeline using Travis CI to see how it differs from Jenkins (coverage with codecov.io, unittesting..)

N.B. all of this is run in the development-environment
